Current Plan:


Notes / Ideas:
1. Create a master gatherer function
2. Hide resources that haven't been unlocked yet
3. Assign jobs to bees
4. Beautify page
5. Align resources and max resources by the "/"
6. Add "game saved" message after saving locally.
    1. message fades after n seconds
7. Fix button/gatherer functions to permit more than 1 gathering per call.
		1. Consider recursion
8. Add flavor text to resources / gatherers / buttons / everything

Game direction:
The enjoyment of this game ought to be:
    1. Discovering new resources / structures
    2. Planning to unlock new resources / structures
    3. Hive growth
